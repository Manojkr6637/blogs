                 💠💠 Senior vs Junior Developer: Approach💠💠 



There isn't a lot of matter between Senior and Junior Developers. It matters only how your approach and learning attitude. 

It hardly matters years of experience. Freshers can be also seniors and seniors can also work like juniors. 

It’s all about your approach, mindset, and what type of project have worked on at large, medium, and small.



🔶Senior Developer

 ✅Take full responsibility

 ✅Self-starter

 ✅Documentation Reading habit

 ✅Most of the time invested in problem-solving and documentation readings

 ✅Stay up-to-date with new trends and new features, deprecated 

 ✅Try to understand the internal library and what best practices and tactics are      used 

 ✅Always think about the project deadline

 ✅Unit & integration testing then overall testing by themself to any functionality and features then given to the tester and QA

 Like every edge case, validation, SEO, HTML semantics, and overall check

✅Investing their time to learn good resources/books/courses 

✅Try to connect with like-minded people, working for networking

✅Learn from different mediums: webinars, seminars, podcasts, books, online   courses, and blogs

 

🔶Junior Developer

❌ Always think it is the responsibility of the Senior Developer

❌Waiting for approval

❌Ignore documentation reading and just Google for everything and copy & paste

❌Ignore lasted features come or not. Even though deprecated features use

❌Blame others and Think done by another team member

❌Most of the time is spent on bugs/issues and google for solutions 

❌Always ignore if complex things found 

❌Without proper and overall testing functional and features are then given to Testing and QA then create a lot of bugs/issues and start fixing bugs. The project will exceed the deadline and then trouble for all.

❌Not investing their time in learning

❌Stay in the same group of people

❌Only learning from senior and self by doing
